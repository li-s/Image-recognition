## Brief overview

### First layers

#### Convolution

1. Runs x number of filters(feature identifiers) across whole image. Each filter represents a specific shape that is to be identified from the image(ie lines, curves on shallow layers, or eyes, noses on deeper layers). Outputs the similarity of the features as numbers as the next layer.
2. Stride determines the distance filter moves, resulting in different output sizes.
3. Padding fills the border of the output with predetermined units(eg 1), so keep input and output size the same.

#### Activation

ReLU (Rectified Linear Units) applies max(0, x) on each input -> changes each negative element to 0. This is to introduce non-linearity to the model

#### Pooling

Downsamples the data. For maxpooling, a filter of x size and x stride goes around the data and outputs the largest number of each subregion it passes through.
This reduces computation cost, and overfitting.

#### Dropout

Sets random activations to 0 in a forward pass. This helps the model train to identify images even when some information is missing.

### Training

1. Passses image through network, and obtain result.(forward pass)
2. Identify loss as a derivative.(loss function)
3. Identify which weights contribute the most to the loss.(backward pass)
4. Update weights.(parameter update)
